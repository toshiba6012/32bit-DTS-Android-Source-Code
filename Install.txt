To install for phones use the arm64-v8a folder. To run Android on computer look
into Remix OS Hacked it's the best one for Android-x86 it has windows and you can
run multiple apps at once. If your using this use the x86_64 folder. Next unpack
the contents of the Home folder to your Phones internal storage. Rename the file
asoundrc to ".asoundrc". Then install Termux app from GooglePlay and run these
commands.

termux-setup-storage

cp libdcaenc.so /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib

chmod 644 /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libdcaenc.so

export PRELOAD_LIBRARY=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libdcaenc.so


Once you have completed the following commands reboot your device and the install
is complete!
