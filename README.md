# 32bit-DTS-Android-Source-Code

Hello once again I've just released the source code and Android.mk file for libdcaenc.so. It uses the ALSA plugin to play back mp3's and flac or any other music format that ALSA supports to DTS Digital Theater Sound. Root is not necessary it has full support of the system and kernel. Follow the directions with the Install text provided closely. Warning once this is installed it is so powerful with a bitrate of 3000 KBPS Bluetooth music playback can't keep up I looked into it Bluetooth is maxxed out at 990 KBPS they call it lossy but it's not lossless. So bluetooth music playback is out of the question to uninstall just remove the dca folder and .asoundrc file from your home directory. Added DroidEdit so you can select copy and paste from Install.txt also added Termux to enter commans. I've deleted it while playing notihng happens it just keeps playing. So it"s part of the bootimage. I'm blown away.  Enjoy the music.



Best regards 
Ryan Johnson
